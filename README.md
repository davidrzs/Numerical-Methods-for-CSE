# Summary for the course Numerical Methods for CSE

This summary has been written by David Zollikofer for the course Numerical Methods for CSE taught by Prof. Dr. Ralf Hiptmair. 
The idea of this summary is to provide a brief overview of the important C++/Eigen functions and some numerical methods which saves times not having to look them up in the 600 page long lecture document.

The summary can be found at this link: [https://github.com/davidrzs/Numerical-Methods-for-CSE/](https://github.com/davidrzs/Numerical-Methods-for-CSE/)

## Compiling

This summary requires a ton of packages. It works on a complete Texlive distribution on linux as well as Miktex on Windows (it will automatically download missing packages in the background, so the first time you compile it might take a while). Alternatively you can also just copy the whole repo into an Overleaf project and use their online compiler.

## I found a mistake? What do I do?

Excellent. Please be so kind and clone this project and add the fix yourself, this way we can directly update the summary in this repo. If you don't feel like doing that or can't do that feel free to send me an email at zdavid@student.ethz.ch
